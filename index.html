                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>In life, it's challenges—not avoidance—that help us grow. In the same way that I approach every challenge in my life with steady, determined progression, I love to do the same with user problems. Whether it's a piece of copy that can improve someone's life or a design that can enhance someone's experience, I see challenges as problems that can be overcome. </p>
                
                <h3>What I Bring to the Table</h3>
                <ul class="skills-list">
                    
                    <li><span ></span><strong>UX writing and simplicity</strong>: Non-sensical designs are a pain in the bum, especially for those who don't have the technological fluency. I make websites simple so you can get more sales.</li>
                    <li><span ></span><strong>Copywriting and branding</strong>: I've worked with some of the world's biggest brands, Nubia, ANTA, Huawei and many more. From launches, to campaigns, to email marketing, to product pages, to blog posts. Simply put, I write researched, data driven, keyword heavy copy that sells.</li>
                    <li><span ></span><strong>Research, research, research</strong>: Until you've walked a mile in your customers shoes you cannot understand their pains, their dreams, their nearly-theres and their setbacks. Thorough targeted research, both quantitative and qualitative is the answer. With a strong understanding of SEO, A/B testing, user interviews, highlighter testing, conversation mining and many more, my copy will guide the user through their past mistakes and toward their future successes.</li>
                    <li><span ></span><strong>Coding and design</strong>: Poor design turns people off. Copy can be near perfect but if a website is poorly designed then a user will not hang around for more than a minute. With a deep understanding of tools like Figma and Webflow as well as the ability to write HTML, CSS and JS, I bring a well-rounded ability that is crucial for understanding the full user experience.</li>
                  
                </ul>
        
                <p>Little by little, a little becomes a lot. I try to stick to this motto everyday. I love learning languages, skills, anything. I speak English and Chinese, and I'm currently learning Polish, with more skills to come. Bring it on!</p>
                
                <p>I'd love to bring my skills to your smart company. Let's do it!</p>

                <p>ANTA is a huge global brand. By some metrics, bigger than Nike or Adidas but what it didn't have was a US site. This is where I came in. For the American and launch of ANTA's new shoe with Kyrie Irving, I created a bold brand voice that resonated with one of the world’s biggest sports brands. During the launch campaign I took charge of the website copy, email campaign and social media posts.</p>
